no use of words: theirself, personality disorder value

value: pure
indifference: their avoidance in social meetings could also cause mental exhaustion
disordered [agoraphobic, borderlineic complex personality disorder] behavior: how they behave and not how they act at its purest definition

bipolar type 0.25
hypomanic disorder without depressive features

the will to become a better human;
with the feelings of being a worse human being comes minor depression features disorder of unknown character

fleeing behavior in these ways; 
fleeing from the unknown people around them [agoraphobic behavior; usually the will to look less anxieted is high because their attitude to that word is different; and they hate to be viewn at as being indifferent]

the will to be a worser human than than they feel like could be due to feelings of worthlessness in the circumstances to minor depression features disorder in the terms of general practise; 
the feelings of worthlessness could also be attributed to low self-esteem;

the poor self-esteem has to do with conflict and avoidance features of personalistic features in a disordered manner;
and particularly in the social meetings with others; 
in regard to how hard it is for them to find solutions on how to be viewn at as a part of the discussion

their proneness to find themselves in a hypomanic state is heightened


Manic-depressive type 0.5

Mania and manic behavior without depression
Explosive mania without any type of depression
Worsened mania with less sleep or lowered quality of sleep

The will to be manic is very high.
The will to be viewn at as manic is high.

They have a will to show themselves in front of the others as a person they in reality not are, in especially these ways: Elegancy: The way they dress.
How they appear in communication with others differs during a manic episode [Histrionic: In general people with Bipolar type 0.5 want to act in a way like those with Histrionic complex personality disorder do but those with Histrionic complex do it per default].


Their will to be viewn at as a person of elegancy and their attempts to show up a high-intellectual [in the eyes of others] side of themselves causes them to flee from the situation; if they do not live up to the expectations that they set. 
Additionally, they have a will to be viewn at as strong and not fragile.

Their attempts to be viewn at as high-intellectual is higher than their will to be rewarded for being this person. This in turn causes quality of sleep disturbance [especially within the smaller prefrontal cortex region called amygdala channel type 4.7[[...]]]

Mental exhaustion: Exhaustion is caused by their indifference to their manipulating and perplexing behavior (it is common for people who act indifferent to become mentally exhausted; if their indifference is used as a tool to be another person than they are. 
They have a medium to high will of being viewn at as a worsener person; manifested especially in front of communication with others . 
Their willingness to interact with the elderly is low or at least lower than expected in the population as a whole.

They use a method to investigate others and which is called Reasoning of a clue in contrast to the method used called Reasoning of a meaning.

bipolar type 0.75
bipolar disorder or bipolar disorder nos due to the effects of prefrontal cortex dementia

explosive dementia-like symptoms; 
especially with reasoning problems (especially in communication) and problems to interpret the surroundings by especially the intent of others and communication on a whole scale and small scale, in these regards: how they interact and reason with others is vastly different than usual

dementia-like methods of reasoning: the inability to understand their problems of reasoning which cause difficulties with where they are inspired by others to understand their reasoning problems and how it affects others and themselves long term and short term; 
due to this their will to be more reasonable with others and with theirself is lowered; 
and the raw consequence is the difficulty to manage their dementia-like symptoms by habilitation

the non-dementia like symptoms are in short: difficulties to interact in a fluid way with others due to them trying and wanting to interact more of in an impulsive and dragon-like way without shortcomings; 
they feel better about it then

the non-dementia like symptoms are in short: manic-like behavior in these ways: their intent to appear reasonable and manic is lowered due to difficulties with interpreting their surroundings and difficulties with interaction due to communicative problems

the non-dementic like symptoms are in short: manic-like behavior in these ways: difficulties interpreting others motives and their own willingness to appear manic is low; 
usually as a consequence of them being non-willing to understand their mania-like behavior

the non real appearance of non-dementic like symptoms follows: the willingness to be depressed is higher than usual because they are not usally happy in being in a manic-like state of body and mind; 
they appear agitated in psychomotoric behavioral ways like running around screaming or hitting themselves or even chewing on themselves, and;
they appear manic in communicational manifestional ways due to their unwantedness and difficulties to appear reasonable;
a manifestation which is one of the core symptoms of mania in bipolar disorder and bipolar disorder nos


bipolar type 1.25
high willingness to committ violent acts against items of property; 
due to behavioral issues with depressive features in mind; 
depression is the main manifestation

high willingness to behave nice against other people; 
especially during mania

they want to behave in a way that others agree upon; 
especially during mania

they want to behave in a way that others disagree upon; 
especially during a depressive state; due to difficulties with behavioral instagram

high wantedness to take over in communication with others; 
either by jumping into discussion or taking over in the conversation

want to insult others by their behavior; 
disregarding from their right to hold a different attitude and behavior in general terms


bipolar type 1.5 (also known as cyclothymic disorder without rapid cycling but with hypomanic features and depressive features of unknown value)

these are the characteristics: the will to jump into conclusion is heightened; 
they want to be looked at as someone special without any reward seeking behavior in these terms: the willingness to be passive during communication with the others due to conflict in mind and agitated behavior; 
their mind is focused on drug intake but they are often too depressed and too passive conversations; so they rarely get hold of drugs due to instagramic problems in conversation and communication with others;
drugs can cause hypomania at prolonged intake;
their passive attitude to drugs is caused by systemic non-overload* and is due to their poor attitude towards drugs in general and their poor understanding of their need to intake drugs as a method to become hypomanic; causing lower levels of education and lower levels of behaving according to the standard of living; 
their pain substreshold is high;
the poor lifestyle choices they are prone to might cause systemic overload in the certain part of the prefrontal cortex; called the prefrontal cortex type 3.74[...];
worsened education, poor standard of living and suicidal tendencies;
communicational issues in these ways: respect to others opinions is high due to prefrontal cortex type 3.74[...] overload
overload against underload in specific areas of the brain could possess a risk to their mental wellbeing; 
the willingness to interact with others is lowered 

they want to be at a disadvantage due to behavioral issues by the use of drugs; 
and these drugs cause prefrontal cortex overload in general terms, and especially; 
the amygdala channel type 3.74[...] has the heaviest of overload by drugs due to instagramic reference in the attempt to behave in a certain way; 
that others cannot understand upon

they are extra prone to be overloaded with serotonin-like ”chemicals” in the region of the brain most commonly issued to cause bipolar disorder; the region of the brain called prefrontal cortex type: 4.6[...]

behaves accordingly to their own needs of behavior; disregarding from what type of needs by default mechanisms









































bipolar type 3.5 (changeable)
the will to become hypomanic or even manic is too high because it increases these aspects: the prefrontal cortex is over-stimulated by serotonin and noradrenalin, which means that their sensory output lowers which negatively affects their will to communicate in an interuptive way which in turn causes them to have problems to reach a conclusion as to how they should interact with the others. due to sensory output lowered they have problems to reach a conclusion as to whether their behavior is appropriate or not; they have nothing to proclaim more than that they are manic or even hypomanic because that is their major goal in interactive measures; they like to be rewarded for being hypomanic which in turn leads to interactive problems, which in turn is caused by their issues in sensory output caused by the use of vigilance and other types of substances like caffeine, substances used for metabolic state disorders and the use of sleep-awakining medicines the use of natural herbs, naming a few: st john’s wort, in the attempts to become hypomanic or in their world the will to become manic which happens under these circumstances: 





































AT THE END WRITE THIS

the so called definition of my own graduated finding of bipolar disorder mixed minor depressive disorder(,) follows: without the reachment that you are depressed. thus the non-availability to reach a conclusion about what type of mental condition you are in

the raw definition of mania-like follows: the appearance seem manic in the appearence of mind and body

the non-raw definition of manic-like symptoms follows: the appearence seem non-manic in either one or both of these: mind and body

the definition of manic-depression: mania or depression
the definition of manic depression: mania and depression
the definition of manic-depressive features: see manic-depression

the raw-like definition of dementia-like follows: the behavior and appearance could be misinterpreted and missdiagnosed as dementia without manic-depressive features; the manic-depressive features of dementia is overseen because they are of hard define character due to the effects of dementia and the absence of mixed manic-depressive symptoms

the non-raw definition of dementic-like symptoms follows: dementia symptoms in the appearence of bipolar disorder and of known value and character in the attempts to be an other person, or; mixed low level dementia with the attempts to be another person in general terms
