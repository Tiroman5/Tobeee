<p><ul><li>During a hypomanic episode, a higher mood can show up as either euphoria (feeling "high") or as crankiness.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Symptoms during hypomanic episodes include:</li></ul>

<ul><li>Flying suddenly from one idea to the next</li>
<li>Having exaggerated self-confidence</li>
<li>Rapid, "pressured" (uninterruptible) and loud speech</li>
<li>Increased energy, with hyperactivity and less need for sleep</li></ul>

<ul><li>People in a hypomanic episodes are often quite pleasant to be around. They can often seem like the "life of the party" â€“ making jokes, taking an intense interest in other people and activities, and infecting others with their positive mood.

The vast majority of people with bipolar II disorder spend more time with depressive symptoms than hypomanic ones. Depression can occur soon after hypomania subsides, or much later. Some people cycle back and forth between hypomania and depression, while others have long periods of normal mood in between episodes.

Untreated, an episode of hypomania can last anywhere from a few days to several months. Most commonly, symptoms continue for a few weeks to a few months.</p>

<p>Depressive episodes in bipolar II disorder are similar to "regular" clinical depression, with depressed mood, loss of pleasure, low energy and activity, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, and thoughts of suicide. Depressive symptoms of bipolar disorder can last weeks, months, or, rarely, years.</p>

Hypomania can also lead to erratic and unhealthy behavior. Hypomanic episodes can sometimes progress onward to full manias that affect a person's ability to function (bipolar I disorder). In mania, people might spend money they don't have, seek out sex with people they normally wouldn't, and engage in other impulsive or risky behaviors with the potential for dangerous consequences.</p>

<p>In bipolar II disorder, the symptoms of elevated mood never reach full-blown mania. Hypomania in bipolar II is a milder form of mood elevation. But the depressive episodes of bipolar II disorder are often longer-lasting and may be even more severe than in bipolar I disorder. Therefore, bipolar II disorder is not simply a "milder" overall form of bipolar disorder.</li></ul></p>
