<p><ul><li>Bipolar I disorder</li></ul></p>

<p><ul><li>Bipolar disorders are mood disorders characterised by episodes of depression and mania or hypomania.</li><ul><p>

<p><ul><li>Bipolar 1 disorder has an associated prevalence of around 1%, which is much lower than the lifetime risk associated with unipolar depression.</li>

<li>The incidence of bipolar disorder follows a bimodal distribution, with two peaks in the age of onset at around 15-24 years and 45-54 years. There is a roughly equal distribution of prevalence between men and women.</li>

<li>Bipolar I disorder is commonly seen in conjunction with other mental health illnesses (e.g. anxiety disorders)</li>

<li>Bipolar I disorder may include periods of euthymia, which is a term used to describe emotionally stable periods.</li></ul></p> 

<p><ul><li>Manic episodes last at least seven days. An individual experiencing a manic episode may experience:</li></ul></p>

<p><ul><li>A marked increase in energy</li> 
<li>Feelings of euphoria</li> 
<li>Hallucinations or delusions</li> 
<li>Increased sexual desire</li> 
<li>Less need for sleep</li></ul></p> 
	
<p><ul><li>Bipolar I disorder:</li></ul></p> 

<p><ul><li>For a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, it is necessary to meet the following criteria for a
manic episode.</li> 
<li>The manic episode may have been preceded by and may be followed by
hypomanic or major depressive episodes.</li><ul></p> 


<p><ul><li>Manic Episode:</li></ul>
<ul><li>A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood 
and abnormally and persistently increased goal-directed activity or energy, lasting</li>
at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if</li>
hospitalization is necessary)</li></ul></p>

<p><ul><li>During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, 3 (or more)
of the following symptoms (4 if the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant
degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior:</li>
<li>Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity</li>
<li>Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep)</li>
<li>More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking</li>
<li>Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing</li>
<li>Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant
external stimuli), as reported or observed</li>
<li>Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or
psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposeless, non-goal-directed activity)</li>
<li>Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful
consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions,
or foolish business investments)</li>
<li>The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or
occupational functioning, or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or
others, or there are psychotic features</li>
<li>The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug
of abuse, a medication, or other treatment) or to another medical condition</li>
<hr>
<p>Note: A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment [e.g., medication,
electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)], but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of
treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic episode, and therefore, a bipolar I diagnosis</li></ul></p>
<hr>
<p><ul><li>Mania and hypomania share the same symptoms.</li>

<li>The difference is in the length of time an individual experiences the symptoms.</li>

<li>Three or more of the above symptoms need to be present for at least 7 days for it to be diagnosed as mania.</li>

<li>If the symptoms last for 4 consecutive days, it is considered hypomania.</li>

<li>In both mania and hypomania, the symptoms are not related to or better explained by schizoaffective disorder or do not overlap with other mood disorders, such as schizophrenia, delusional disorder, or another medical condition.</li></ul></p>

<hr>

<p>Bipolar disorder with mixed features</p>

<p><ul><li>A study found those with a history of bipolar disorder with mixed states were at higher risk of suicidal behavior, compared to those without a history of mixed states.</li></ul></p>


<p>Most people are in their teens or early 20s when they experience their first episode of bipolar disorder with mixed episodes. Women and men are at equal risk. Having a relative who has experienced bipolar disorder is a risk factor as well, suggesting that one may be more likely to develop the disorder.

Overall, between 40% and 50% of people who are diagnosed with bipolar disorder experience mixed episodes at some point in their illness.</p>


<p><li>Among the disorders that frequently co-occur with bipolar disorder:</li>

    <li>Substance use disorders</li>

    <li>Anxiety disorders</li>

    <li>Borderline personality disorder</li>
</p>


<p>Lithium as a mood stabilization drug has been successful as a medication for treating people with Bipolar 1 disorder.</p>

<p>
    <li>Mood stabilizers</li>

    <li>Antipsychotics</li>

    <li><s>Antidepressants</s></li>

    <li>Anti-anxiety medications</li>
